# Gemini Agent Context

This file provides context for the Gemini agent working on the `friends_badge` project.

## Project Goal

The main goal is to port an existing Android application for programming e-paper badges to a
reusable Flutter package. An example application will also be developed to demonstrate the package's
usage.

## Current Status

The project is in the initial restructuring phase. The following files have been created to guide
the development process:

- **`TODO.md`**: This file contains a detailed checklist of the development plan. Please refer to
  this file to understand the current progress and the next steps.
- **`NOTES.md`**: This file contains important technical details, code snippets, and potential
  challenges that were identified during the initial analysis of the original Android application.
- **`DATA_FORMAT.md`**, **`BLE_FORMAT.md`**, **`NFC_FORMAT.md`**, **`END_TO_END_EXAMPLE.md`**: These
  files contain the documentation of the original Android app's communication protocols and data
  formats.

## Instructions for the Next Agent

1. **Review the `TODO.md` file** to understand the current state of the project and the remaining
   tasks.
2. **Consult the `NOTES.md` file** for technical details and potential gotchas.
3. **Follow the development plan** outlined in `TODO.md` to continue the project.
4. **The user has requested to start with the project restructuring.** The next step is to create
   the `example` directory.
